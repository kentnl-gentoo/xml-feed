0.12  2006.08.13
    - Generate Atom 1.0 feeds by default. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for
      the patch.

0.11  2006.08.07
    - Fixed a bug in XML::Feed::Atom where entry->link and feed->link didn't
      return the proper link element if the "rel" attribute wasn't defined for
      a <link /> tag. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the patch.

0.10  2006.07.17
    - Oops, an Atom test in 01-parse.t was previously succeeding only because
      of a bug in XML::Atom. Now that that bug is fixed, this one is now
      fixed, too.

0.09  2006.07.10
    - Fixed date format errors with XML::Feed::RSS. Thanks to Tatsuhiko
      Miyagawa for the patch.
    - Use add_module to properly add namespaces to the RSS document. Thanks
      to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the patch.

0.08  2006.03.03
    - $feed->author wasn't being converted properly by Feed->convert. Thanks
      to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the patch.
    - Added eval around Entry->issued calls, to properly catch invalid
      date formats, and just return undef, rather than dying. Thanks to
      Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the spot.
    - Fixed issued/modified format issue with dates in timezones other than
      UTC. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for the patch.

0.07  2005.08.11
    - Added XML::Feed::splice method, to make feed splicing easier.
    - Fixed some unitialized value warnings.

0.06  2005.08.09
    - Added Feed->convert and Entry->convert methods to allow conversion
      between formats.
    - Added ability to create new Feed and Entry objects, add entries, etc.
    - Added $PREFERRED_PARSER variable to allow usage of compatible
      RSS parsers, like XML::RSS::LibXML. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa
      for the patch.

0.05  2005.01.01
    - Call URI::Fetch::URI_GONE() instead of URI::Fetch::FEED_GONE(). Thanks
      to Richard Clamp for the patch.

0.04  2004.12.31
    - Use "loose" parsing in DateTime::Format::Mail so that we don't die
      on invalid RFC-822 dates.
    - XML::Feed::Entry->link on RSS feeds will now use a <guid> element
      if a <link> element isn't found.
    - Switched to using URI::Fetch when fetching feeds. Since we're not
      storing or caching feeds currently, this basically just buys us
      GZIP support, but that's something.

0.03  2004.10.09
    - Fixed bug with feed format detection: properly detect format even in
      feeds with <!DOCTYPE> at the top. (Thanks to Alberto Quario for the
      note.)
    - Use Class::ErrorHandler instead of XML::Feed::ErrorHandler.
    - Moved auto-discovery code into Feed::Find. XML::Feed->find_feeds is
      now just a wrapper around that module.

0.02  2004.07.29
    - Changed behavior of Entry->summary to prevent it from returning the
      full contents of the entry. Now, in an RSS feed, summary only returns
      a value if there is both a <description> element *and* one of the
      other elements typically used for the full content.
    - Changed content model for Entry->content and Entry->summary.
      They now return an XML::Feed::Content object, which knows about both
      the actual content and the MIME type of the content.
    - Improved feed format detection by first tag in feed.

0.01  2004.06.01
    - Initial distribution.
