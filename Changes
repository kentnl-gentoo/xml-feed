Revision history for XML::Feed

0.02
    - Changed behavior of Entry->summary to prevent it from returning the
      full contents of the entry. Now, in an RSS feed, summary only returns
      a value if there is both a <description> element *and* one of the
      other elements typically used for the full content.
    - Changed content model for Entry->content and Entry->summary.
      They now return an XML::Feed::Content object, which knows about both
      the actual content and the MIME type of the content.
    - Improved feed format detection by first tag in feed.

0.01  2004.06.01
    - Initial distribution.
