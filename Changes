Revision history for XML::Feed

0.03  2004.10.09
    - Fixed bug with feed format detection: properly detect format even in
      feeds with <!DOCTYPE> at the top. (Thanks to Alberto Quario for the
      note.)
    - Use Class::ErrorHandler instead of XML::Feed::ErrorHandler.
    - Moved auto-discovery code into Feed::Find. XML::Feed->find_feeds is
      now just a wrapper around that module.

0.02  2004.07.29
    - Changed behavior of Entry->summary to prevent it from returning the
      full contents of the entry. Now, in an RSS feed, summary only returns
      a value if there is both a <description> element *and* one of the
      other elements typically used for the full content.
    - Changed content model for Entry->content and Entry->summary.
      They now return an XML::Feed::Content object, which knows about both
      the actual content and the MIME type of the content.
    - Improved feed format detection by first tag in feed.

0.01  2004.06.01
    - Initial distribution.
